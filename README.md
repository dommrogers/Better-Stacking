# Better-Stacking


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It reduces inventory clutter by changing which items can be stacked and how certain items are stacked.

Items that will be stacked even if their condition does not match.  
The condition of the resulting stack will be the overall condition of all items in the stack:

* Matches
* Cured Pelts and Hides
* Cured Guts
* Cured Saplings
* Painkillers and Antibiotics
* Coffee Tins and Herbal Tea Packages
