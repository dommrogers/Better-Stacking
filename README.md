# Better-Stacking


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It reduces inventory clutter by changing which items can be stacked and how certain items are stacked.


> This warning does not currently apply, but it will in future updates.
> Right now, it is perfectly safe to remove the mod after stacking items.
> **Warning:**  
> Uninstalling this mod while there are still stacked items (from the list below) will result in **losing those items**, as their stack size will be reset to 1 after loading the game.  
> This applies to all items in the inventory and all containers (cupboards, trunks, etc.).  
> Dropping items on the floor or creating stacks with only one item should be safe.  



Items that were stacked when they have a matching condition:

* Currently, there are none of these items. I'm working on adding some.



Items that will be stacked even if their condition does not match.  
The condition of the resulting stack will be the overall condition of all items in the stack:

* Matches
* Dried Pelts
* Dried Saplings
